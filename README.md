# Semantic Matching Between Documents Using Term Co-Occurence Graph
# 1. Motivation
Predict the salary for the job profile posted in Indeed using many features such as
* HumansUnderstand Semantics!
* Many times news articles contain events which are similar to the events
which have happened in the past.However, as the terms used in these two
articles may be different, the pure lexical feature based similarity mining
approach fails to identify the similarity many times.
* Hence, there is a need of unsupervised approaches which use features
beyond the terms present in the documents to match them.

Mean squared Erros(MSE) is used to calculate the prediction accuracy. Our task
is to reduce the MSE as much as possible

# 2. Applications
* Identification of similar judiciary cases, given a new case
* Identification of similar patents, given a new patent.
* Looking for similar medical cases to under stand the treatment.
* Retrieval of a similar product using its description or reviews on an e-
commerce website
* Relating with the previous news article, given a new news.
* Comparing movie plots.
* The literal terms in a user’s query may not match those of a relevant
document.In addition, most words have multiple meanings. Hence the user
end up surfing through a lot of useless documents.

# 3. Problem Statement
* In this project, we attempt to solve two kinds of semantic similarity problems namely
    * Identification of semantic similarity (identifying the similarity score between the given pairs of documents)
    * Semantically similar information retrieval (retrieving similar documents for a given document from a corpus). 
 
    As we deal with the study of semantics, we define it as the deeper similarity inthe meaning of the conceptsunderconsideration.
